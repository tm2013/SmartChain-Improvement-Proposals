# SmartChain Improvement Proposals (SIP)
Improvement proposals for the Radium SmartChain.

You may submit SmartChain improvement proposals at any time via a pull request to the Submitted branch.
Submitted proposals which are reasonable enough are brought before the community and developers for review. These will be located in the In-review branch.
Proposals which pass review will be moved to the Approved-in-development branch. Once complete and integrated, these proposals will be moved to the master branch.
